 <h1>about me</h1>
<p>

Hi my name is Sarah, I'm 20 years old and i've just finished my leaving certificate,
i decided to study computing beacuase i always wanted to know more about programming and how do technologies work.


</p>
<p>

  I chose Marilyn_Monroe beacuase her death was a mysterious death and she is the icone of beauty but even though she lived a sad life
as she had miscarriage and also her mother suffered from mental illness and she made her self or gave her life
a meaning with all the trouble and the gossip she had.
