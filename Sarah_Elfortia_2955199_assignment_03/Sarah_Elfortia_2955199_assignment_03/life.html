 <p>Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926 as the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (née Monroe, 1902–1984).[3] Gladys, the daughter of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper and worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries.[4] When she was fifteen, Gladys married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917–1933)[5] and Berniece (born 1919).[6] She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky.[7] Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met her for the first time as an adult.[8] In 1924, Gladys married her second husband—Martin Edward Mortensen—but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe by a different man; they divorced in 1928.[9] The identity of Monroe's father is unknown and Baker was most often used as her surname.[10][a]</p>
<br>
<p>Monroe's early childhood was stable and happy.[14] While Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, she was able to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of Hawthorne soon after the birth.[15] They raised their foster children according to the principles of evangelical Christianity.[14] At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to move back to the city in early 1927.[16] She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles.[14] Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in Hollywood.[17] They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie.[18] Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.[19] After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital.[20] She spent the rest of her life in and out of hospitals and was rarely in contact with Monroe.[21]</p>
