<p>In late 1944, Monroe met photographer David Conover, who had been sent by the U.S. Army Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) to the factory to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers.[47] Although none of her pictures were used by the FMPU, she quit working at the factory in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends.[48][49] She moved out of her in-laws' home, defying them and her husband, and signed a contract with the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945.[50] As a model, she occasionally used the name Jean Norman.[51] She straightened her curly brunette hair and dyed it blonde to make her more employable.[51] Her figure was deemed more suitable for pin-up than fashion modeling, and she was featured mostly in advertisements and men's magazines.[52] The agency's owner, Emmeline Snively, said that Monroe was one of its most ambitious and hard-working models; by early 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers for publications such as Pageant, U.S. Camera, Laff, and Peek.[53]</p>

<p>Impressed by her success, Snively arranged a contract for Monroe with an acting agency in June 1946.[54] After an unsuccessful interview with producers at Paramount Pictures, she was given a screen-test by Ben Lyon, a 20th Century-Fox executive. Head executive Darryl F. Zanuck was unenthusiastic about it,[55] but he was persuaded to give her a standard six-month contract to avoid her being signed by rival studio RKO Pictures.[c] Monroe's contract began in August 1946, and she and Lyon selected the stage name "Marilyn Monroe".[57] The first name was picked by Lyon, who was reminded of Broadway star Marilyn Miller; the last was picked by Monroe after her mother's maiden name.[58] In September 1946, she divorced Dougherty, who was against her having a career.[59]</p>
